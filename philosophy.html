            <p class="section-subtitle">(Creator's Extended Version)</p>
            <div class="philosophy-block">
                <p>From the Colosseum to the Capitol, from Versailles to the Louvre — civilizations carve their values into stone, law, ritual, and myth. When those structures rot, it's not the marble that cracks first. It's meaning. And once meaning destabilises, everything else follows.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">WatchTheFall exists because I can feel that destabilisation in real time.
                Not as a prediction — as a lived experience. The cracks aren't subtle anymore. You can hear them.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Why I Watch the Fall</h3>
                <p>Because most people only see symptoms.
                Rising prices. Friction between cultures. Leaders who speak but don't mean. Institutions running on fumes.
                But beneath all that… something deeper is shifting.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We're living through a civilisation that has forgotten the code that built it.
                Rights once protected by blood are now treated as negotiable.
                Identity once rooted in history is now treated as optional.
                Power has drifted upwards into global structures no one voted for.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">I document the fall not to celebrate it — but because you can't fix what you refuse to see.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">What I Believe</h3>
                
                <h4 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem;">1. Sovereignty Isn't a Slogan — It's Survival</h4>
                <p>A nation that can't control its borders, energy, resources, or data… isn't a nation.
                I support Scottish independence for the same reason I criticise globalist overreach:
                people deserve systems they can actually steer.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Sovereignty isn't about flags.
                It's about accountability.
                It's about knowing that if something breaks, you can fix it — not send an email to Brussels, London, or Davos.</p>
                
                <h4 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem;">2. Freedom Is Meant to Be Inconvenient</h4>
                <p>We've drifted into a culture where discomfort is treated as harm and censorship is framed as safety.
                But freedom that offends no one, threatens nothing, and challenges nothing… isn't freedom.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Speech is the canary in the coal mine.
                If it dies, everything dies with it.</p>
                
                <h4 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem;">3. Identity Isn't a Toy</h4>
                <p>You can't build a functioning society on melting sand.
                Mass migration without cultural cohesion fractures trust.
                Pretending men and women are interchangeable breaks institutions designed for safeguarding.
                Denying national identity dissolves the thread that binds generations.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Diversity works when it's compatible.
                When people share the same basics: values, expectations, reality.</p>
                
                <h4 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem;">4. Technology Should Liberate, Not Dominate</h4>
                <p>AI, automation, robotics — these should be tools that free people from pointless labour, not systems of control.
                Every home should generate its own energy.
                AI should drive productivity, not surveillance.
                Digital systems should come with analog fallbacks.
                And data privacy isn't a luxury — it's a right.</p>
                
                <h4 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 1.5rem 0 0.5rem;">5. The Future Shouldn't Be Designed Only for the Rich</h4>
                <p>We're heading toward a world where billionaires live in utopias and everyone else rents their existence.
                BlackRock buys the land.
                Governments police speech.
                WHO writes policy.
                And ordinary people get the fallout.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">That future isn't inevitable — unless we stay asleep.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Why the Fall Matters to Me</h3>
                <p>Because collapse isn't just political — it's personal.
                I've watched systems break from the inside.
                I've lived through the pressure ordinary people are carrying — debt, stress, isolation, the sense that society is accelerating while the ground underneath is eroding.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">When I talk about "the fall," I'm not talking about apocalypse fantasies.
                I'm talking about:</p>
                
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 2rem;">
                    <li>the slow decay of institutions that were supposed to protect us</li>
                    <li>the hollowing-out of meaning</li>
                    <li>the loss of trust between rulers and ruled</li>
                    <li>the creeping sense that we're governed by people who don't like us</li>
                    <li>and the belief that someone else is steering our future</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>But watching the fall isn't despair.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">It's clarity.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">You can't rebuild a civilisation until you understand why the old one collapsed.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">The Vision Beyond the Fall</h3>
                <p>A nation that actually belongs to its people.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">With energy sovereignty, transparent government, and a constitution that protects speech, privacy, property, and identity.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A culture that values truth over ideology.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Where we stop pretending biology is offensive.
                Where we stop baptising incompetence as compassion.
                Where we stop exiling common sense.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A future where technology amplifies human freedom.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">AI as a multiplier of human potential — not a leash.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A society with a backbone again.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Not hysterical, not fragile, not afraid to stand for something real.</p>
                
                <h3 style="color: var(--color-gold); margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Why WatchTheFall Exists</h3>
                <p>Because symbols shape reality — and when symbols break, the truth leaks through the cracks.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The glitch isn't a distortion.
                It's the reveal.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">These posters aren't just art.
                They're the archaeology of a civilisation breaking open.
                They're the warnings our leaders refuse to give.
                They're reminders that the world you grew up in is not the world you're living in now.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">To watch the fall isn't nihilism.
                It's self-defence.
                It's awareness.
                It's the first step in building the world that comes after.</p>
